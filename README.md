    Lario can double jump if jump is pressed twice/
    Coins and hearts will be collected once you get close.
    Lario has some momentum, so be careful of that.
    Jump on the heads of enemies to destroy them.
    Enemies have a path that they follow. Time your moves so you can get by them or destroy them.
    Lario has a second of invulnerability if you are hurt by an enemy.
    Lario has 3 hearts, but you can find more in the level when you are hurt, up to 3.
    Jump up under the breakable blocks to break them.
    Get to the end, and rescue your precious pony!
